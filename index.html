          <p>
            These angels are described as having solid black eyes, having a shoulder span measured in miles.
            Al-Suyuti described from Hadith recorded Al-Hakim al-Nishapuri and from Sunan Abu Dawood Munkar and Nakir carrying hammers "so large,
            that it cannot be moved even if whole of mankind unite to lift it".
            From another Hadiths, al-Suyuti quoted from Ibn Abi al-Dunya, Al-Bayhaqi, and Musnad al-Bazzar that when Munkar and Nakir spoke, tongues of fire come from their mouths.
            If one answers their questions incorrectly, one is beaten every day, other than Friday, until Allah (God) gives permission for the beating to stop.
            Al-Suyuti also mentioned from the hadith Munkar and Nakir digging out to reach the dead person location using their teeths and their hairs were reaching their feets.
